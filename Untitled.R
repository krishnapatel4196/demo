#exercises 3.2.5
#Q1 : In a single pipeline for each condition, find all flights that meet the condition
#Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
#Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
#Were operated by United, American, or Delta
#Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
#Arrived more than two hours late but didnâ€™t leave late
#Look at this: Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight(flight departure delay by 30 min or more but arraival time is same)
